Safe water is a basic human right, yet over 100 communities in Canada don't have this fulfilled. Communities are looking for a continuous, reliable, low-maintenance, and cost-effective solution to provide potable water. Mayaqua is a modular drinking water treatment system that meets these criteria. Our current prototype is designed to fulfill the needs of around 100 people, with future iterations being planned to scale up to 500 people. In addition, there will be customized solutions for communities with special issues, such as high concentrations of arsenic.
