 Nappi Lab aims to improve the accuracy of early-stage testicular cancer and relapse detection through rolling circle amplification (RCA) and electrochemical biosensors with patient blood samples. Existing diagnostic methods put patients at risk of over-treatment and long-term chemotherapy toxicity. Our design is more personalized, sensitive, cost-efficient and easier to use. Preliminary results are promising and warrant further development of the design.
