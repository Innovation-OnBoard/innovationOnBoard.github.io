 Insporos' intelligent seed sorting technology revolutionizes modern greenhouse operations, which are increasingly reliant on sensors and robotics that demand uniform plant growth. By identifying and eliminating diseased and defective seeds, Insporos helps growers avoid overplantingâ€”a common practice due to the unpredictability of seed success, leading to significant resource waste. Traditionally, a typical greenhouse facility discards plants amounting to $15M annually in resources. However, by ensuring that every planted seed counts, Insporos' seed analysis platform significantly mitigates this waste, potentially saving facilities up to $10M per year in resource costs.
