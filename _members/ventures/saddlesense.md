 SaddleSense is a data-driven bike saddle fitting tool. For cyclists, poorly fitting saddles are a major source of discomfort while riding—pressure between their body and their bike saddle can cause acute pain and numbness. Our ‘smart’ saddle measures the pressure profile of the cyclist while riding and advises the cyclist on which off-the-shelf saddle to purchase, to optimize comfort and performance. SaddleSense removes uncertainty from the saddle buying process—so that cyclists can go the distance.
