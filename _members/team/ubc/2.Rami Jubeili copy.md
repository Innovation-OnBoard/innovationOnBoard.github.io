  I am a master of applied science student in chemical engineering at UBC, driven by a passion to form a sustainable relationship with the world. My interests lie in heterogeneous catalysis, zero GHG emission energy production, and the integration of machine learning in process industries. Currently, I am conducting research on the use of molten metal catalysts for economically feasible production of ultra-pure hydrogen.
