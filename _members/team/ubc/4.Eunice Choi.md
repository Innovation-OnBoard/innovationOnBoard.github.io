  I am a chemical and biological engineering student at UBC, passionate about sustainability and how I can contribute in the future as an engineer. Currently, I am broadening my understanding of the engineering industry by working as a Junior Process Engineer at Chemetics (Worley), a company that specializes in sulphuric acid and chlorine chemical production. I am also a member of the student council in my department.
