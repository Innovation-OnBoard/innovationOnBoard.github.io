biography: >
I am a fourth-year UBC computer science student with a deep interest in all things STEM. I am particularly passionate about software development, artificial intelligence, and data science. I have worked on various projects that showcase my skills in coding and innovative thinking. Outside of work, I love staying active through running, hiking with friends, or enjoying an occasional skate session at one of Vancouver's many parks.
