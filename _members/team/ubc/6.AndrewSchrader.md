biography: >
  I am a fourth-year UBC computer science student with a deep interest in all things STEM. I am particularly passionate about software engineering, artificial intelligence, and robotics. I have worked at multiple companies while leading various projects that showcase my skills in programming and problem solving. Outside of work, I love staying active through running, hiking with friends, or enjoying an occasional skate session at one of Vancouver's many parks.
