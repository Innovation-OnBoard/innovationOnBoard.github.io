I am a Bioinformatics student at UBC, currently in the first year of my Master's program. My primary interest lies in computer-aided drug discovery, specifically implementing machine learning techniques to enhance virtual screening. The opportunity to be part of InnovationOnBoard excites me as it provides hands-on experience in translating scientific and business ideas into innovative projects.
