biography: >
  I am a Bioinformatics student at UBC in the 1st year of my Master's program. I am interested in computer-aided drug discovery and focus on implementing machine learning to facilitate virtual screening techniques. Being a part of InnovationOnBoard is an exciting opportunity to gain hands-on experience in transforming scientific and business ideas into innovative projects that bridge the gap between science and entrepreneurship.
