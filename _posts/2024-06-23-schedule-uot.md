The event kicks off with an industry-specific speed-dating session, allowing co-founders to meet and explore ideas with founders. Afterward, attendees can network freely during an open social. The event wraps up with team registration, where teams of 1 founder plus 1-4 co-founders are formed for the final pitch competition.</p>
